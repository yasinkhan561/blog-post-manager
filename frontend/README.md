üöÄ Local Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to get the frontend server running locally. Ensure you have started the Dockerized backend API first.

1. Install Dependencies
   Navigate to this frontend directory and install all required packages:

Bash

npm install

# or

yarn install

2. Run the Development Server

Start the application using Vite:

Bash

npm run dev

# or

yarn start

The application will typically be available at http://localhost:3000.

‚ú® Core Features & Implementation Details

1. State Management (Redux Toolkit)
   All application data is managed via Redux Toolkit slices, with API interactions handled using Async Thunks to manage loading and error states.

Efficient Updates: The updatePostAction is optimized for performance. Instead of triggering a full data re-fetch after a successful save, it dispatches a local updatePost action to instantly modify only the specific post in the Redux state. This avoids unnecessary network overhead.

Data Synchronization (Creation): The createPostAction performs a full list fetch (dispatch(fetchPosts())) after a successful creation to guarantee the main list is synchronized before redirecting to the new post's detail page.

3. Iconography (Font Awesome)
   Icons are managed using @fortawesome/react-fontawesome for high-quality SVG rendering.

Custom Component: The custom Icon component simplifies usage across the application, handling consistent styling (color, size) based on theme variables.
